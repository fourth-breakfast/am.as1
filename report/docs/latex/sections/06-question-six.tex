\subquestion{a}{Reflect on the interpretation of the BMI coefficient. Does it capture the \textbf{causal effect} of body fat on income?}

\subquestion{b}{Draw a \textbf{DAG} illustrating how an \textbf{omitted variable} could bias the estimated effect of BMI on income and indicate one such variable.}

\subquestion{c}{Based on your DAG, would the resulting bias in the BMI coefficient be \textbf{upward or downward}? Explain.}

\subquestion{d}{Identify a variable (not necessarily observed in your dataset) that could act as a \textbf{collider} in this context. Use a DAG to illustrate and explain why conditioning on it would lead to bias.}

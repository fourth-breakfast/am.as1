\note{Researchers want to estimate the effect of \textbf{peers' risky health behaviors} (alcohol consumption) on the \textbf{academic performance of adolescents} by exploiting the quasi-exogenous assignment of high-school students across classes. They want to use the \textbf{peers' fathers' drinking behavior} as an instrumental variable for peers' risky health behaviors. They estimate a linear regression model with peers' risky health behaviors as the dependent variable (measured as the average number of times peers consumed alcohol in the past month) and the peers' fathers' drinking as an explanatory variable. The coefficient of this explanatory variable is \textbf{positive and statistically significant}.}

\note{Based on this information, what is your \textbf{assessment} of this identification strategy to estimate the
effect of peersâ€™ risky health behaviors on the academic performance of adolescents?}

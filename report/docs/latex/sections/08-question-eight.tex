\note{We now consider using a variable that indicates how many times in the past seven days an individual has had sweetened drinks as an instrument for BMI.}

\note{Estimate the model of Question 2 by 2SLS, using \icode{drinks} as an instrumental variable for BMI.}

\subquestion{a}{Write down the estimated first stage of the model.}

\subquestion{b}{\textbf{Interpret} the estimated coefficient for \icode{drinks} in the first stage regression. Is the estimated coefficient of BMI and its significance obtained with the IV estimator different from the OLS estimator in question 2? Does this suggest that the variable is endogenous or not? Discuss [Note: For this question, do not perform any additional analysis]}

\subquestion{c}{Perform a \textbf{formal test} of the null hypothesis that BMI is \textbf{exogenous}. What do you conclude? Explain.}

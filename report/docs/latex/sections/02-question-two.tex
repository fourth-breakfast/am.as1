\question{2}{0.9 points}

\note{Estimate a multivariate regression model explaining income as a function of BMI and whether the individual is black. Thus, estimate: \begin{equation}income= \beta_0 + \beta_1BMI + \beta_2black + u\end{equation}}

\subquestion{a}{Interpret the estimated coefficients of all the explanatory variables (\textbf{sign, magnitude, and significance}).}

\subquestion{b}{What is the estimated 95\% Confidence Interval of $\beta_1$? What can you conclude based on the information in this confidence interval about the \textbf{effect of BMI on income}?}

\subquestion{c}{What is the \textbf{relative magnitude} of the effect of being black on income? Interpret the relative magnitude.}

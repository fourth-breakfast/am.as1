\question{3}{0.9 points}

\note{In the previous question, we have assumed that the association between income and BMI is linear.}

\subquestion{a}{Do you think this assumption is likely to hold? Explain.}

The above assumption is not likely to hold. In reality, we would expect values both at the very high and very low BMI thresholds to be associated with lower income, suggesting a non-linear relationship. 

Extremely low BMI could account for malnutrition or severe health issues, both of which we would expect to be related to lower incomes, as malnutrition shows difficultty accessing resources and severe health issues might limit an individual's capacity to earn a stable income.

While it is true that a higher BMI might be related to abundance, an extremely high BMI would be related to medical problems as severe as those found in extremely low BMI cases. It is worth noting that social stigma could also negatively impact an individual's ability to secure an income while extremely overweight.

\subquestion{b}{Add $\boldsymbol{BMI^2}$ to the regression of question 2 and estimate it. What is the estimated effect of BMI on income? In your answer, interpret the effect at two different points of the BMI distribution.}

\begin{minted}{stata}
gen bmi2 = bmi^2
reg income bmi bmi2 black, robust    
\end{minted}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \caption{Linear Regression: Non-linearities}
        \input{\tables reg3b.tex}
        \label{tab:reg3b}    
    \end{center}
\end{table}

Analyzing the new model, we can see that the \icode{bmi} coefficient is now positive, while the \icode{bmi2} coefficient is negative. This suggests quadratic relationship where income first increases with BMI, then decreases. It follows the form

\begin{equation}
    \text{Income} = 40,704 + 390.96 \times \text{BMI} - 10.85 \times \text{BMI}^2
\end{equation}

We will compare the effects of BMI on income taking two points, BMI = 20 and BMI = 30. In the first case 

\vspace{-1em}

\begin{equation}
    40,704 + 390.96 \times 20 - 10.85 \times 20 = 44,183.2
\end{equation}

while, in the second case

\vspace{-1em}

\begin{equation}
    40,704 + 390.96 \times 30 - 10.85 \times 30 = 42,667.8
\end{equation}

We see that income is lower at 30 BMI compared to 20 BMI. This coincides with our prediction that the relationship between income and BMI follows a non-linear pattern.

\subquestion{c}{How does adding $BMI^2$ capture non-linearities in the relationship between BMI and income?},

As seen in the previous question, the marginal effect of BMI on income at different points of the BMI scale can have not just different magnitudes, but even different signs altogether. Since a linear model assumes a constant effect and cannot therefore accurately represent this pattern, adding $BMI^2$ allows the slope of our model to vary at different BMI values.

\subquestion{d}{What is your \textbf{preferred specification} (2 or 3)? Explain.}

The non-linear specification is preffered over the original especification, since it allows the model to capture the relationship between income and BMI without assuming a linear pattern between the variables.

\question{3}{0.9 points}

\note{In the previous question, we have assumed that the association between income and BMI is linear.}

\subquestion{a}{Do you think this assumption is likely to hold? Explain.}

\subquestion{b}{Add $\boldsymbol{BMI^2}$ to the regression of question 2 and estimate it. What is the estimated effect of BMI on income? In your answer, interpret the effect at two different points of the BMI distribution.}

\subquestion{c}{How does adding $BMI^2$ capture non-linearities in the relationship between BMI and income?}

\subquestion{d}{What is your \textbf{preferred specification} (2 or 3)? Explain.}

\note{What is your preferred model? Why?}

Statistically speaking, we cannot say which of the models computed are our preferred model. The regression models throughout this assignment have all resulted in significantly low R-Squared values, which indicate that very little of the variation in the relationships examined are explained. In terms of statistical significance, we'd prefer the IV 2SLS regression as the first stage regressions explain the endogenous variable of BMI very well with significant p-values of our black and drinks variable at the 5\% and 10\% level respectively. However, there is also an argument for the OLS regression as it is efficient and also the most unbiased indicator, which would make sense to use as the tests showed insignificant evidence of omitted variable bias. 

To conclude, although the IV regression has the best statistical significance (even though all models are mostly insignificant), we believe that the regression model from 4.d, which examines the percentage change in income as a function of the effect of BMI across the different categories of BMI and whether the individual is black. We feel that this regression model does the best job at describing how income changes in relation to BMI as well as race, by categorizing BMI which interacts with the race of the individual to showcase the change in the effect of BMI on income.

\note{Are any of the models in Question 2, Question 3 and Question 4 \textbf{correctly specified}? Explain with your own words. (Note: For this question, focus on functional form).}

In order to test for omitted variables in our models, we can run Ramsey RESET tests on the regression models from questions 2, 3 and 4. In Stata, that can be comfortably done using the \icode{estat ovtest} command:

\begin{minted}{stata}
reg income bmi black, robust
(output omitted)

estat ovtest

Ramsey RESET test for omitted variables
Omitted: Powers of fitted values of income

H0: Model has no omitted variables

F(3, 439) =   2.63
 Prob > F = 0.0496
\end{minted}

\begin{minted}{stata}
reg income bmi bmi2 black, robust
(output omitted)

estat ovtest

Ramsey RESET test for omitted variables
Omitted: Powers of fitted values of income

H0: Model has no omitted variables

F(3, 438) =   3.24
 Prob > F = 0.0219
\end{minted}

\newpage

\begin{minted}{stata}
reg ln_income ib2.bmi_cat black, robust
(output omitted)

estat ovtest

Ramsey RESET test for omitted variables
Omitted: Powers of fitted values of ln_income

H0: Model has no omitted variables

F(2, 438) =   4.35
 Prob > F = 0.0135
\end{minted}

\begin{minted}{stata}
reg ln_income ib2.bmi_cat##i.black
(output omitted)

estat ovtest

Ramsey RESET test for omitted variables
Omitted: Powers of fitted values of ln_income

H0: Model has no omitted variables

F(2, 438) =   4.35
 Prob > F = 0.0135
\end{minted}

Perhaps unintuitively, a p-value $<=$ 0.05 is, in the context of this test, \emph{not} a promising result when analyzing a model. The RESET test is specified as:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
H_0&: \text{The model is correctly specified (no omitted variables)}\\
H_1&: \text{The model is misspecified (omitted variables exist)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Looking at the RESET results for our models, the fact that all p-values fall below the significance level implies that, actually, we can reject all the null hypotheses and conclude that \emph{none} of our models so far have been correctly specified!
